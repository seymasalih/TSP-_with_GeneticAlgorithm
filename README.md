# TSP-_with_GeneticAlgorithm
Solving the Travelling Salesman problem with an improved genetic algorithm.

Among the various operators of the genetic algorithm: Elitism (selection operator), PMX (crossover operator), CIM (mutate operator) gave the best result.
It is shown how it gives a result on the coordinates given below.
